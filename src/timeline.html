		<h2>Intel's History and Innovation-The Timeline</h2>
	</div> 
<div id="y1968">
	<h2>1968-1979</h2>
	<h6>1968</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Intel Formed by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, previous employees of Fairchild Semiconductor.</li>
			<li>Andy Grove soon joined and became known as a “three-headed monster” by Bob Noyce.</li>
		</ul>
	<h6>1969</h6>
	<ul>	
			<li>Japanese calculator manufacturer Busicom asked Intel to design a chipset for programmable calculators.</li>
			<li>Intel engineer Ted Hoff created a four-chip set with a general purpose that the device would be able to access the instructions from memory.</li>
			<li>Federico Faggin teamed with Hoff to develop the 4004, the first microprocessor, that had as much computing power as the first electronic computer, the ENIAC.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>1971</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>4004 is released</li>
			<li>Intel opened offices in Tokyo, France and the U.K. with Germany a year later</li>
			<li>Gordon was approached with idea that would later become the PC</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The idea was to put the 8080 microprocessor with a keyboard and monitor then sell it onto the home market.</li>
					<li>Gordon’s response, “What’s it good for? And the only answer was that a house-wife could keep her recipes on it. I personally didn’t see anything useful in it, so we never gave it another thought.”</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<center><img src="img/intel44.JPG"></img></center>
	<h6>1975</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>After 8080 Processor entered the market, the Intel Advanced Processor Architecture 432 (iAPX) was born.</li>
		<li>Purpose was to create a new microprocessor architecture, a new system architecture and new operating system software as well.</li>	
		<li>It was to feature fault tolerance and self-checking hardware, which was later added into the Pentium processor.</li>
		<li>Proved to be too complex and was phased out in the 1980’s.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>1979</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Although Intel’s 16-bit 8086 and 8-bit 8088 received steady purchases, Intel also received completion from Motorola’s 68000 designs.</li>	
		<li>In response, Intel launched campaign in 1980 to make the 8086/8088 architecture to become the industry standard under the code-name “Operation Crush” with the objective to generate 2,000 design wins within the year.</li>
		<li>Operation crush a success with 2,500 design wins.</li>
		<li>IBM chose 8088 as the microprocessor for its first PC. First time IBM chose an outside vendor for a microprocessor.</li>

	</ul>
</div>

<div id="y1985">
	<h2>1985-2000</h2>
	<h6>1985</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>The Intel386 chip is developed which was supported from 1985 to 2007.</li>
		<li>Previously second sourced manufacturing of chips and selling Intel products to other companies in exchange for royalties and/or rights to other products.</li>
		<li>When Intel’s microprocessor line increased in value and candidates did not keep up with the pace of exchange, Intel decided to be the sole manufacturer.</li>
		<li>Andy notes during the time that “I think AMD, especially thought we were bluffing. They did not meet their commitments, thinking we’d need their help eventually to meet demand”.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>1989</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Intel started a “Red X” campaign which consisted of a red x being put over 286 to put a message to switch over to the Intel386 SX and 32-bit machines.</li>
		<li>First time sending a message to PC users with the new Windows operating system coming soon.</li>
		<li>Found to be very successful, Intel was afraid that if the campaign failed it would have killed the 286 and no one moving to the new chip.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>1993</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Intel introduces Pentium processor, five times more powerful than the i486 processor from 1989.</li>
		<li>After two years, the Intel Inside campaign helps shoot Intel to become the third most valuable brand in the world.</li>
		<li>Fortune cover has Intel Pentium processor as the leader in “The New Computer Revolution”.</li>
	</ul>
	<center><img src="img/intelpent.jpg"></img></center>
	<h6>1994</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Jeopardy contestant correctly answers that Intel chips power about 85% of all desktop computers.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>1995</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Space shuttle Endeavor conduct first real-time, PC-based conference from space using Intel Proshare videoconferencing technology.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>1996</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Ted Hoff, Stan Mazor and Federico Faggin inducted into National Inventors Hall of Fame for developing microprocessor 25 years before.</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>1998</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Intel announces first high-performance, low-power processors based on StrongARM technology for handheld computing and communication devices.</li>
		<li>Intel launches first processor for PC market, Intel Celeron processor.</li>
		<li>Intel Pentium II Xeon processor for mid-range and high-end workstation and server markets.</li>
	</ul>
